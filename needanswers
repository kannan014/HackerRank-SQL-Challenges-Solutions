Suppose thereâ€™s a log of security related incidences for about 60 days along with instance_id. Now, there are cases when the incident is reported but the incident_id is not. 

- Your goal is to find out - how many incidents have **incident_id** on a given day. How many percentage of incidents have a non-null id?
- The time is in UTC, so convert that into IST.
- What time of the day does the incident_id percentage is lower?
